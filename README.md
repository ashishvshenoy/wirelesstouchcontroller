Wireless Touch Controller (WTC) is a remote communication application that connects your PC and a touch enabled mobile device.

It is an application built on HTML5 and Javascript on the client side and Visual C# on the server side. The Javascript makes use of open source libraries such as Hammer.js which allows a multi touch functionality and gesture recognition on the device. The server side was built using C#.
This project aims to provide a remote mouse, keyboard and joystick support basic operations which include tap, double tap, right click, number pad, letter pad and analog 360 degree joystick. The package has a user-friendly interface that is menu-oriented, iconic and a combination of both.
